Books inevitably reflect the opinions and prejudices of their authors. Some read-
ers will inevitably disagree with my opinions and with my choice of material. Such
disagreement is a healthy reflection of the diversity of the discipline and is essential
for its evolution. Nevertheless, I hope that all software engineers and software engi-
neering students can find something of interest here.
